By the due date ({{ page.due | date: "%a %m %d %Y at %H:%M"}}), please:
* Complete Chapter 4, including completing, or at least attempting, all of the participation and challenge.

If you find that you are stuck on any of the exercises in Chapter 4, please bring your questions about those to the first lecture after the due date, or to office hours or lab (discussion section).

You will be given one additional week to complete whatever you are stuck on, but given that we are moving quickly through chapters 5, 6, 7 in the coming weeks, it's good to try to keep up.
