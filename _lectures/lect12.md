In today's class you will critique some code that I have written using the superhero data set that we have been working with.

Start by navigating to the code published on github:
<https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-f22/lectures/tree/main/lect12>

1. Go to the v00 directory and read the code in demo.cpp

Think of one change to improve how the code is organized. Discuss with your neighbor. Then repond with one or two sentences when I open the clicker "short answer" poll.

During class I will create improved versions of the code and save them in the directories v01, v02,...

2. Go to the v01 directory and read the code available there.
Once again, think of 1 - 3 improvements to make the code more readable.
