In today's class you will critique some code that I have written that uses the superhero dataset.

Start by navigating to the code published on github:
<https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-f22/lectures/tree/main/lect12>

During class I will create improved versions of the code and save them in the directories v01, v02,...

0. We'll begin by writing a Makefile 

1. Go to the v00 directory and read the code in demo.cpp

Think of one change to improve how the code is organized. Discuss with your neighbor. Then repond with one or two sentences when I open the clicker "short answer" poll.

2. Go to the v01 directory and read the code available there.
Once again, think of 1 - 3 improvements to make the code more readable.
